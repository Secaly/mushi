Mushi
=====

Mushi is a minimalistic open-source bug tracker.
It offers a clear separation between its backend and its frontend, so you can easily pick replace either with your own.

The backend is written in Python 3 (yes, it is 2015 py-2.x lovers), on the top of incredibly excellent Flask micro-framework, and SQLAlchemy for the persistence.
The frontend is written with Twitter's Bootstrap and Facebook's React.js.
